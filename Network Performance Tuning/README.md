# Network Performance Tuning Script

If you have Realtek Ethernet Device then download and open the .bat file with admin rights:

[Network Performance Tuning](https://github.com/moffa89/Windows-Gaming-Tweaks/blob/main/Network%20Performance%20Tuning/Network%20Performance%20Tuning.bat) 

If you have other Ethernet Device then look for your Buffers in Ethernet Driver options and set them to max.

# Now your ethernet is optimized for gaming ;-)
